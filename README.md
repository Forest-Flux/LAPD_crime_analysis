# LAPD CRIME ANALYSIS

## Research Question
This research will investigate the factors contributing to the delay between the occurrence of a crime and its reporting to the Los Angeles Police Department. The study aims to identify which variables, including crime type, victim demographics, location, and timing, influence whether a crime is reported immediately or after a significant delay. Additionally, the analysis will examine whether these patterns differ between violent and property crimes. The decision to report a crime is not random; it may be influenced by factors such as fear, perceived severity, trust in law enforcement, or practical barriers such as lack of knowledge about reporting procedures or time constraints. By applying classification analysis to LAPD crime data from 2020 to 2025 (approximately 1,000,000 records and 28 variables), the research will determine which factors most strongly predict reporting delays. Insights from this analysis will assist the LAPD in identifying communities or crime types that encounter barriers to timely reporting, informing strategies to build trust, allocate resources effectively, and promote equitable access to police services across all neighborhoods.
### Research Hypothesis
Violent crimes, such as assault with deadly weapons, are expected to exhibit significantly shorter reporting delays compared to non-violent crimes, such as theft. Specifically, violent crimes are anticipated to be reported within 24 to 48 hours of occurrence, whereas theft and fraud-related crimes are expected to demonstrate reporting delays exceeding several days and even months.
